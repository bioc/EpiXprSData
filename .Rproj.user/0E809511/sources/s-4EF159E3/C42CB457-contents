Description: Models constructed on paired DNA methylation and gene expression
    counts for the purpose of predicting expression in samples with only DNA
    methylation. This data package is designed to be used in conjunction with 
    the EpiXprS Bioconductor package. Contains 8 race-interaction models, 8
    African American models, and 30 European American models.
